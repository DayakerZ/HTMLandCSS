        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
            dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
            a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
            and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
            brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
            stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
            strong it and seemed ready to slide 
            off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
            compared with the size of the rest of him,waved about 
            helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
            thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
            room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
            between its four familiar walls</p>
